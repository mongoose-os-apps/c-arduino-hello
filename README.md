# Arduino API usage example

## Overview

This is a simple demonstration of using Arduino compatibility in
Mongoose OS. An app uses Arduino's `setup()` and `loop()` routines,
and uses a standard Arduino `digitalWrite()` API.

This example app uses C++ as a programming language. However, Mongoose OS
adds a JavaScript API for many of the Arduino libraries - see other examples.

## How to install this app
